CONSUMING PHOTOS FROM JSON PLACEHOLDER API
 1. The internal style was used in structuring of the ui layout.
 2. For javaScript part. The fetch promise function was used to fetch 500 copies of photos from jsonplaceholder rest api.
 3. To reduce the number of pictures coming from the api to manageable size, javaScript slice() function was used to slice it to 20 copies.
 4. API   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
